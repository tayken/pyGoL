## DESCRIPTION

A Conway's Game of Life implementation in Python using curses.

## USAGE

Just type
```bash
./pyGoL.py
```
to run the game of life program. The default width is 133 characters, height is 41 characters and each cycle (tick) is 20 ms. The default values are defined in the main function and set to my terminal settings, just change them to something you like. Or you can use
```bash
./pyGoL.py -w <width> -h <height> -t <tick>
```
where width and height are in characters and tick is in increments of 10 ms.

## LICENSE
I don't really care so I chose the unlicense. Just have fun with it and if you really want to read the license, read LICENSE file.
